# Automatic-Image-Captioning
Caption generation is a challenging artificial intelligence problem where a textual description must be generated for a given 
photograph.

It requires both methods from computer vision to understand the content of the image and a language model from the field of natural 
language processing to turn the understanding of the image into words in the right order. Recently, deep learning methods have achieved
state-of-the-art results on examples of this problem.

Deep learning methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art results on caption generation problems. What is most impressive about these 
methods is a single end-to-end model can be defined to predict a caption, given a photo,

## Project Overview
* Prepare Photo And Text Data
* Develop Deep Learning Model
* Train With Photo Data
